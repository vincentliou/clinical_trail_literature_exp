NCT00096278,Bevacizumab,3,N/A,"The study aimed to investigate the safety and efficacy of adding bevacizumab to FOLFOX6 for the adjuvant treatment of patients with stage 2-3 colon cancer, based on previous benefits observed in advanced colorectal cancer.",The trial was designed to have 90% power to detect a 23.4% reduction in the hazard of DFS event.,"Patients with stage 2 or 3 colon adenocarcinoma, ECOG performance status of 0 or 1, and no history of certain cardiovascular events were included. Exclusion criteria included history of cerebral vascular accident, transient ischemic attack, symptomatic peripheral vascular disease, or an arterial thrombotic episode within 12 months before randomization.",N/A,"Randomized, open-label, phase III trial comparing modified FOLFOX6 for 6 months with or without bevacizumab for 12 months. The primary endpoint was disease-free survival (DFS), and overall survival (OS) was a secondary endpoint.","The primary endpoint was disease-free survival (DFS), defined as colon cancer recurrence, second primary cancer of any type, or death from any cause.",Overall survival (OS) was a secondary endpoint.,The trial was designed to detect a 23.4% reduction in the hazard of DFS event.,"The study design, including the open-label nature and the difference in treatment duration between arms, may affect the interpretation of DFS results and the ability to inform further development.","Of 2,710 patients enrolled, 2,678 were evaluated for OS and 2,673 for DFS. A small percentage had no follow-up or were not at risk for recurrence.","Participant characteristics were well balanced between treatment arms, with a median follow-up of 4.9 years. Approximately 25% of patients had stage 2 disease.","The analysis included all patients with follow-up, excluding those with no follow-up or not at risk for the primary endpoint.","Sub-group analyses were conducted based on stage of disease and timing of recurrence, with a pre-specified time-by-treatment interaction analysis.",The addition of bevacizumab did not result in a statistically significant increase in DFS or OS. A transient effect on DFS was observed during bevacizumab exposure.,"The addition of bevacizumab was associated with increased grade 3-4 toxicities such as hypertension, wound complications, pain, and proteinuria, but no increase in mortality.","Results were consistent across subgroups, with no evidence of a detrimental effect of bevacizumab on DFS or OS.",The study did not meet the sponsor's goals of significantly prolonging DFS or OS with bevacizumab. The results may be perceived as disappointing given the lack of benefit in the adjuvant setting.
NCT00100841,Cetuximab,2,N/A,"The study aimed to determine the safety and efficacy of cetuximab added to bevacizumab plus standard mFOLFOX6 as first-line therapy for metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC), based on promising activity in chemotherapy-refractory mCRC.",A prohibitive serious adverse event rate not exceeding 8.5% was defined as the bar for success in terms of safety.,"Patients had histologically or cytologically confirmed, unresectable adenocarcinoma of the colon or rectum with measurable metastatic disease. No previous treatment with chemotherapy for metastatic disease was permitted, except for adjuvant setting treatment without oxaliplatin, bevacizumab, or cetuximab. Patients needed an ECOG performance status of 0 or 1, be 18 years or older, and have a life expectancy > 3 months.",N/A,"This was a phase II trial evaluating the safety and efficacy of cetuximab combined with bevacizumab plus mFOLFOX6. The primary endpoint was toxicity, and the study included a 2-stage safety analysis. Treatment was continued until progression of disease, unacceptable toxicity, or patient withdrawal.","The primary endpoint was toxicity, specifically the rate of prohibitive serious adverse events (PSAEs).",Secondary endpoints included evaluation of objective response and progression-free survival (PFS).,N/A,"The study design focused on safety, which may limit its ability to inform efficacy-related decisions for further development or approval.",56% of patients discontinued therapy before disease progression due to toxicity (29%) or patient withdrawal (27%).,"The median age was 57 years, 53% were male, 30% had previous adjuvant chemotherapy, and 65% had 2 or more organs involved by metastases.",The analysis included all treated patients (66 out of 67 enrolled). One patient did not begin therapy due to deterioration in performance status.,N/A,"The study did not surpass the prespecified PSAE rate deemed to be prohibitively toxic, but the high rate of discontinuation due to cetuximab-associated toxicity suggests limited tolerability.","Common grade 3–4 adverse events included diarrhea (14%), fatigue (14%), neuropathy (12%), venous thrombosis (9%), acneiform rash (8%), and desquamation (8%).","The results were consistent with known cetuximab-associated toxicities, but the high discontinuation rate suggests issues with tolerability.",The study did not meet sponsor goals for a viable treatment regimen due to high toxicity and discontinuation rates. Results may be perceived negatively by consumers due to the poor tolerability of the regimen.
NCT00098787,"5-fluorouracil, leucovorin, oxaliplatin (FOLFOX)/bevacizumab (Bev) and irinotecan, oxaliplatin (IROX)/Bev",2,N/A,The study hypothesized that metastatic colorectal cancer patients with low thymidylate synthase (TS-L) expression would have a higher response rate with FOLFOX/Bev than patients with high TS (TS-H) tumors; and IROX/Bev would be more effective than FOLFOX/Bev in TS-H tumors.,N/A,"Patients were included if they were 18 or older with metastatic colorectal cancer, no prior therapy for metastatic or locally recurrent disease, measurable disease, ECOG performance status of 0–2, and met specific laboratory criteria. Exclusions included recent myocardial infarction, unstable angina, symptomatic arrhythmia, significant peripheral artery disease, grade 2 or worse peripheral neuropathy, history of stroke or transient ischemic attack within 6 months, and pregnancy.","TS protein expression was determined in mCRC tissue using immunohistochemical staining, a method previously described and used in the study.","The study was a Phase II trial where patients with TS-L tumors received FOLFOX/Bev, and those with TS-H tumors were randomized to FOLFOX/Bev or IROX/Bev. The primary endpoint was response rate (CR+PR). An interim analysis was conducted, and the study was reopened to provide more precision on response rate estimates.","The primary endpoint was the response rate (CR+PR), measured by the percentage of patients achieving complete or partial response.","Secondary endpoints included progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), and toxicity.",N/A,"The study design allowed for real-time determination of TS expression to guide treatment assignment, which could inform personalized treatment strategies in mCRC.","247 patients were registered to step 1, and 211 to the treatment phase. 186 patients were eligible and started treatment. Reasons for not proceeding to step 2 included ineligibility, withdrawal, unknown TS status, disease progression, or insurance issues.","Participants were balanced in terms of age, gender, race, and disease status. However, there was a higher proportion of PS 0 patients in the TS-H FOLFOX/Bev arm.","The efficacy analysis included eligible patients who started treatment (N=186), while the safety analysis included all patients who started treatment (N=205).",Sub-groups were based on TS expression levels (TS-L vs TS-H) and were pre-specified to evaluate differential treatment responses.,"The study found that TS-L patients had a longer PFS compared to TS-H patients treated with FOLFOX/Bev, with a PFS HR of 1.6 (P=0.04). However, the OS comparison was not significantly different.","Safety findings included higher grade 3+ diarrhea in TS-L patients treated with FOLFOX/Bev and in TS-H patients treated with IROX/Bev. Eleven patients experienced lethal events, mostly related to underlying colorectal cancer.","Results were consistent with the hypothesis that TS-L patients benefit more from FOLFOX/Bev, but TS-H patients did not benefit more from IROX/Bev than FOLFOX/Bev.","The study met its goal of evaluating TS as a prognostic biomarker for 5-FU benefit, supporting its use in guiding treatment for mCRC. However, TS-H patients still derived benefit from 5-FU-based therapy."
